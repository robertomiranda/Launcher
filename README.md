# BASIC WEB LAUNCHER

## Build targets

The primary useful build targets are the usual suspects:

  - `mvn clean` -- to clear out previous build results
  - `mvn compile` -- only compile, then stop
  - `mvn test` -- only compile and run tests, then stop
  - `mvn package` -- build and create an executable jar file and distribution tarball


## Running locally

    $ java -jar target/Launcher-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
